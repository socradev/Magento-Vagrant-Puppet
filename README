    git clone https://github.com/socradev/Magento-Vagrant-Puppet.git site_dir
    cd site_dir
    
Run initial vagrant setup:

    vagrant up

Reload vagrant (issue with modules geting executed out of order):

    vagrant reload

Error installing magento
------------------------
see http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/284882/
The problem seems to be in wrong version PHP SimpleXML extension. Hereâ€™s another workaround:

Replace in file app/code/core/Mage/Install/etc/config.xml (near 71th string) this

<extensions>
    <pdo_mysql/>
</extensions>
with this

<extensions>
    <pdo_mysql>1</pdo_mysql>
</extensions>


after that, run the failed command in the vagrant ssh session
after that, from the host system, run vagrant provision
